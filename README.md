## JWT Implementation Documentation

### Overview
This document outlines the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in the SecureApp to manage authentication and session management.

### JWT Access Tokens
- **Purpose**: Access tokens are used to securely authenticate users to various endpoints.
- **Expiration**: Access tokens expire in 15 minutes, requiring re-authentication or a refresh token to continue the session.

### JWT Refresh Tokens
- **Purpose**: Refresh tokens allow users to obtain new access tokens without re-entering credentials.
- **Expiration**: Refresh tokens expire in 7 days.

### Protected Routes
- `/users/me`: Returns the details of the authenticated user. Requires a valid access token to access.
- Other routes that require authentication should be listed here.

### Refresh Token Process
- **Endpoint**: `/auth/refresh`
- **Method**: Users submit their refresh token to this endpoint to receive a new access token if the original token has expired.

### Security Measures
- JWTs are verified using a secure key (environment variable recommended for the key storage).
- Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs before storage and comparison.

### Conclusion
JWTs provide a robust method for managing authentication and session states in SecureApp, ensuring that user interactions are secure and private.
