## JWT Implementation Documentation

### Overview
This document outlines the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in the SecureApp to manage authentication and session management.

### JWT Access Tokens
- **Purpose**: Access tokens are used to securely authenticate users to various endpoints.
- **Expiration**: Access tokens expire in 15 minutes, requiring re-authentication or a refresh token to continue the session.

### JWT Refresh Tokens
- **Purpose**: Refresh tokens allow users to obtain new access tokens without re-entering credentials.
- **Expiration**: Refresh tokens expire in 7 days.

### Protected Routes
- `/users/me`: Returns the details of the authenticated user. Requires a valid access token to access.
- Other routes that require authentication should be listed here.

### Refresh Token Process
- **Endpoint**: `/auth/refresh`
- **Method**: Users submit their refresh token to this endpoint to receive a new access token if the original token has expired.

### Security Measures
- JWTs are verified using a secure key (environment variable recommended for the key storage).
- Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs before storage and comparison.

### Conclusion
JWTs provide a robust method for managing authentication and session states in SecureApp, ensuring that user interactions are secure and private.

## Module 5: Serialization and Deserialization

### Implementation Overview
Implemented a `User` class with serialization capabilities using a `toJSON` method. Created two endpoints:
- **POST /serialize**: Takes user data, creates a `User` object, serializes it to JSON, and returns the JSON string.
- **POST /deserialize**: Accepts a JSON string, deserializes it to a `User` object using a controlled, whitelisted approach to ensure security.

### Security Measures
Implemented deserialization with whitelisting by checking and validating the JSON structure before creating a `User` object. This method ensures that only valid `User` objects can be recreated, safeguarding against unauthorized or malicious data manipulation.

### Testing Procedure
Used Postman to send requests to both endpoints:
- **Serialization Request**: `{ "id": 1, "username": "testuser", "email": "test@example.com" }`
- **Deserialization Request**: `{ "serializedUser": "{\"id\":1,\"username\":\"testuser\",\"email\":\"test@example.com\"}" }`

Received correct and secure responses from both operations, confirming the integrity and effectiveness of the implementation.

### Conclusion
The serialization and deserialization processes were successfully implemented with an emphasis on security, particularly through the use of class whitelisting during deserialization. This approach is critical in preventing common vulnerabilities associated with deserialization, such as unwanted object creation or code execution.


## Module 6: Authentication and Authorization Best Practices

### Overview
Implemented several best practices aimed at strengthening the authentication and authorization mechanisms of our application. These measures are critical in protecting against unauthorized access and ensuring that confidential data remains secure.

### Implementations and Justifications
- **Strong Password Policies**: Enforced complexity requirements and rate limiting to mitigate brute force attacks.
- **JWT for Session Management**: Utilized JWTs for secure session management, ensuring tokens are signed with a secure secret and transmitted securely via HTTPS.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implemented RBAC to ensure users can only access resources appropriate to their permissions.
- **Security Headers and CSRF Protection**: Added multiple security headers and CSRF tokens to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

### Testing
Conducted thorough testing to verify the effectiveness of these security measures, including attempts to bypass security controls and access unauthorized data. All measures performed robustly without any breaches.

### Conclusion
The implemented security measures have significantly enhanced the security framework of our application, providing robust protection against unauthorized access and ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user data.
